## Dashboard User Documentation

Welcome to the **Hotel Analytics Dashboard**. This application is designed to help hotel managers visualize reviews, understand competitive positioning, and identify actionable areas for improvement.

### How to Start the Dashboard
1. Ensure your virtual environment is active and dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Run the Streamlit application from the root directory:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
   ```
3. The dashboard will automatically open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Data Source Toggle
At the top of the sidebar, you can toggle **"🧪 Use ML Sample Dataset"**. This switches the dashboard from the massive >90,000 review database to the lightweight `reviews_sample.db` (5,000+ reviews), which is useful for rapid testing or running on machines with limited memory.
